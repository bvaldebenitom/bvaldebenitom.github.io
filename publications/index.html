I previously showed that Transposable Elements (TEs) become activated in early GC (EGC), suggesting a role in gene expression. Here, I follow-up on that evidence using single-cell data from gastritis to EGC, and show that TEs are expressed and follow the disease progression, with 2,430 of them being cell populations markers. Pseudotemporal trajectory modeling revealed 111 TEs associated with the origination of cancer cells. Analysis of spatial data from GC also confirms TE expression, with 204 TEs being spatially enriched in the tumor regions and the tumor microenvironment, hinting at a role of TEs in tumorigenesis. Finally, a network of TE-mediated gene regulation was modeled, indicating that   2,000 genes could be modulated by TEs, with   500 of them already implicated in cancer. These results suggest that TEs might play a functional role in GC progression, and highlights them as potential biomarker for its early detection. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/preview_statintes-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/preview_statintes-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/preview_statintes-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/preview_statintes.png" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="auto" height="auto" alt="preview_statintes.png" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="Valdebenito-Maturana2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Activation of Transposable Elements in Human Skeletal Muscle Fibers upon Statin Treatment.</div> <div class="author"> <em>Braulio Valdebenito-Maturana</em>, Franco Valdebenito-Maturana, Mónica Carrasco, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

Statins, which are hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, are drugs used to reduce the endogenous cholesterol synthesis, thus minimizing its pathophysiological effects. Despite the proven benefits, statins therapy is known to cause a number of skeletal muscle disorders, including myalgia, myopathy and myositis. The mechanisms underlying such statin-induced side effects are unknown. Recently, a group of genes and molecular pathways has been described to participate in statin-induced myopathy, caused by either simvastatin or rosuvastatin, although the mechanism by which changes in gene regulation occur was not studied. Transposable Elements (TEs), repetitive elements that move within the genome, are known to play regulatory roles in gene expression; however, their role in statin-induced muscle damage has not been studied. We analyzed the expression of TEs in human skeletal fiber cells treated with either simvastatin or rosuvastatin, as well as their respective controls, and identified TEs that change their expression in response to the treatment. We found that simvastatin resulted in &gt;1000 differentially expressed (DE) TEs, whereas rosuvastatin resulted in only 27 DE TEs. Using network analysis tools, we predicted the impact of the DE TEs on the expression of genes and found that amongst the genes potentially modulated by TEs, there are some previously associated to statin-linked myopathy pathways (e.g., AKT3). Overall, our results indicate that TEs may be a key player in the statin-induced muscle side effects.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Valdebenito-Maturana2022a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Dysregulated Expression of Transposable Elements in TDP-43M337V Human Motor Neurons That Recapitulate Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis In Vitro.</div> <div class="author"> <em>Braulio Valdebenito-Maturana</em>, Matias Ignacio Rojas-Tapia, Mónica Carrasco, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

The disease is divided into familial and sporadic ALS. Mutations in the TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) have been involved in the pathological emergence and progression of ALS, although the molecular mechanisms eliciting the disease are unknown. Transposable elements (TEs) and DNA sequences capable of transposing within the genome become dysregulated and transcribed in the presence of TDP-43 mutations. We performed RNA-Seq in human motor neurons (iMNs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from TDP-43 wild-type-iMNs-TDP-43WT-and mutant-iMNs-TDP-43M337V-genotypes at 7 and 14 DIV, and, with state-of-the-art bioinformatic tools, analyzed whether TDP-43M337V alters both gene expression and TE activity. Our results show that TDP-43M337V induced global changes in the gene expression and TEs levels at all in vitro stages studied. Interestingly, many genetic pathways overlapped with that of the TEs activity, suggesting that TEs control the expression of several genes. TEs correlated with genes that played key roles in the extracellular matrix and RNA processing: all the regulatory pathways affected in ALS. Thus, the loss of TE regulation is present in TDP-43 mutations and is a critical determinant of the disease in human motor neurons. Overall, our results support the evidence that indicates TEs are critical regulatory sequences contributing to ALS neurodegeneration.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Rodriguez-Quiroz2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">SoloTE for improved analysis of transposable elements in single-cell RNA-Seq data using locus-specific expression.</div> <div class="author"> Rocío Rodríguez-Quiroz, and <em>Braulio Valdebenito-Maturana</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Communications biology</em>, Oct 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Transposable Elements (TEs) contribute to the repetitive fraction in almost every eukaryotic genome known to date, and their transcriptional activation can influence the expression of neighboring genes in healthy and disease states.

Although a current computational approach is available for the single cell analysis of TE expression, it omits their genomic location. Here we show SoloTE, a pipeline that outperforms the previous approach in terms of computational resources and by allowing the inclusion of locus-specific TE activity in scRNA-Seq expression matrixes. We then apply SoloTE to several datasets to reveal the repertoire of TEs that become transcriptionally active in different cell groups, and based on their genomic location, we predict their potential impact on gene expression.

Using novel bioinformatic tools and publicly available RNA-Seq datasets, our results indicate that a significant number of genic and intergenic TEs are differentially expressed during the SG development.

TEs contribute to a large fraction of the repetitive elements of a genome, and because of their nature, they are not routinely analyzed in RNA-Seq gene expression studies. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal neurodegenerative disease, and a well-accepted model for its study is the mouse harboring the human SOD1G93A mutant. In this model, landmark stages of the disease can be recapitulated at specific time points, making possible to understand changes in gene expression across time. While there are several works reporting TE activity in ALS models, they have not explored their activity through the disease progression. Moreover, they have done it at the expense of losing their locus of expression. Depending on their genomic location, TEs can regulate genes in cis and in trans, making locus-specific analysis of TEs of importance in order to understand their role in modulating gene expression. Particularly, the locus-specific role of TEs in ALS has not been fully elucidated. In this work, we analyzed publicly available RNA-Seq datasets of the SOD1G93A mouse model, to understand the locus-specific role of TEs. We show that TEs become up-regulated at the early stages of the disease, and via statistical associations, we speculate that they can regulate several genes, which in turn might be contributing to the genetic dysfunction observed in ALS.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Valdebenito-Maturana2021c" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">GSER (a Genome Size Estimator using R): a pipeline for quality assessment of sequenced genome libraries through genome size estimation.</div> <div class="author"> <em>Braulio Valdebenito-Maturana</em>, and Gonzalo Riadi</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Interface focus</em>, Jun 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The first step in any genome research after obtaining the read data is to perform a due quality control of the sequenced reads.

Some HKTs underlie salt tolerance responses in plants, while others provide a mechanism to cope with short-term K+ shortage by allowing increased Na+ uptake under K+ starvation conditions. HKT channels present a functionally versatile family divided into two classes, mainly based on a sequence polymorphism found in the sequences underlying the selectivity filter of the first pore loop. Physiologically, most class I members function as sodium uniporters, and class II members as Na+/K+ symporters. Nevertheless, even within these two classes, there is a high functional diversity that, to date, cannot be explained at the molecular level. The high complexity is also reflected at the regulatory level. HKT expression is modulated at the level of transcription, translation, and functionality of the protein. Here, we summarize and discuss the structure and conservation of the HKT channel family from algae to angiosperms.

However, estimating the origin of expression of TEs through RNA-seq is complicated by multi-mapping reads coming from their repetitive sequences. Current approaches that address multi-mapping reads are focused in expression quantification and not in finding the origin of expression. Addressing the genomic origin of expressed TEs could further aid in understanding the role that TEs might have in the cell. RESULTS We have developed a new pipeline called TEcandidates, based on de novo transcriptome assembly to assess the instances of TEs being expressed, along with their location, to include in downstream DE analysis. TEcandidates takes as input the RNA-seq data, the genome sequence and the TE annotation file and returns a list of coordinates of candidate TEs being expressed, the TEs that have been removed and the genome sequence with removed TEs as masked. This masked genome is suited to include TEs in downstream expression analysis, as the ambiguity of reads coming from TEs is significantly reduced in the mapping step of the analysis.

Changing environmental conditions influence competition. A pertinent model to exemplify the complex interplay of the microorganisms in the human dental biofilm is the competition between Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mutans. It has been reported that children and adults harbor greater numbers of S. sanguinis in the oral cavity, associated with caries-free teeth. Conversely, S. mutans is predominant in individuals with a high number of carious lesions. Competition between both microorganisms stems from the production of H2 O2 by S. sanguinis and mutacins, a type of bacteriocins, by S. mutans. There is limited evidence on how S. sanguinis survives its own H2 O2 levels, or if it has other mechanisms that might aid in the competition against S. mutans, nonetheless. We performed a genomic and metabolic pathway comparison, coupled with a comprehensive literature review, to better understand the competition between these two species. Results indicated that S. sanguinis can outcompete S. mutans by the production of an enzyme capable of metabolizing H2 O2 . S. mutans, however, lacks the enzyme and is susceptible to the peroxide from S. sanguinis. In addition, S. sanguinis can generate energy through gluconeogenesis and seems to have evolved different communication mechanisms, indicating that novel proteins may be responsible for intra-species communication.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Valdebenito-Maturana2017" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Mutantelec: An In Silico mutation simulation platform for comparative electrostatic potential profiling of proteins.</div> <div class="author"> <em>Braulio Valdebenito-Maturana</em>, Jose Antonio Reyes-Suarez, Jaime Henriquez, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 4 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '4 more authors' ?

Understanding the effect that amino acid mutations will have on the electrostatic potential of a protein, will allow a thorough understanding of which residues are the most important in a protein. MutantElec, is a friendly web application for in silico generation of site-directed mutagenesis of proteins and the comparison of electrostatic potential between the wild type protein and the mutant(s), based on the three-dimensional structure of the protein. The effect of the mutation is evaluated using different approach to the traditional surface map. MutantElec provides a graphical display of the results that allows the visualization of changes occurring at close distance from the mutation and thus uncovers the local and global impact of a specific change. \textcopyright 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Schott2016" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Cooperation through Competition-Dynamics and Microeconomics of a Minimal Nutrient Trade System in Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis.</div> <div class="author"> Stephan Schott, Braulio Valdebenito, Daniel Bustos, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

Until now it is not clear how this nutrient exchange system works. Here, we used computational cell biology to simulate the dynamics of a network of proton pumps and proton-coupled transporters that are upregulated during AM formation. We show that this minimal network is sufficient to describe accurately and realistically the nutrient trade system. By applying basic principles of microeconomics, we link the biophysics of transmembrane nutrient transport with the ecology of organismic interactions and straightforwardly explain macroscopic scenarios of the relations between plant and AM fungus. This computational cell biology study allows drawing far reaching hypotheses about the mechanism and the regulation of nutrient exchange and proposes that the "cooperation" between plant and fungus can be in fact the result of a competition between both for the same resources in the tiny periarbuscular space. The minimal model presented here may serve as benchmark to evaluate in future the performance of more complex models of AM nutrient exchange. As a first step toward this goal, we included SWEET sugar transporters in the model and show that their co-occurrence with proton-coupled sugar transporters results in a futile carbon cycle at the plant plasma membrane proposing that two different pathways for the same substrate should not be active at the same time.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Gonzalez2015" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">K₂p channels in plants and animals.</div> <div class="author"> Wendy González, Braulio Valdebenito, Julio Caballero, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 9 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '9 more authors' ?

A functional channel is a dimer with each subunit comprising two pore-forming loops and four transmembrane domains. The genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana harbors five genes coding for K2P channels. Homologs of Arabidopsis K2P channels have been found in all higher plants sequenced so far. As with the K2P channels in mammals, plant K2P channels are targets of external and internal stimuli, which fine-tune the electrical properties of the membrane for specialized transport and/or signaling tasks. Plant K2P channels are modulated by signaling molecules such as intracellular H(+) and calcium and physical factors like temperature and pressure. In this review, we ask the following: What are the similarities and differences between K2P channels in plants and animals in terms of their physiology? What is the nature of the last common ancestor (LCA) of these two groups of proteins? To answer these questions, we present physiological, structural, and phylogenetic evidence that discards the hypothesis proposing that the duplication and fusion that gave rise to the K2P channels occurred in a prokaryote LCA. Conversely, we argue that the K2P LCA was most likely a eukaryote organism. Consideration of plant and animal K2P channels in the same study is novel and likely to stimulate further exchange of ideas between students of these fields.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Braulio Valdebenito-Maturana.
