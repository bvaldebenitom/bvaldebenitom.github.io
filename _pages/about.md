Hey!

I'm Braulio Valdebenito-Maturana. I apply bioinformatics to scientific problems. Particularly, my research focus is the development and application of computational methods to understand gene regulation. To this end, I'm currently using novel technologies such as single cell RNA-Seq and spatially-resolved RNA-Seq.

In this website you will find tutorials and resources to help you in exploring the exciting world of genome-wide gene expression analyses!
